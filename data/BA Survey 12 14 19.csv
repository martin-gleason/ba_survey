Looking into the building codes I believe there are numerous violations that are not being addressed.  Plus I, as well as other locals have never seen anyone going to them.  There has been activity noticed at night, but it’s all Chinese people.  I don’t think these places are legit and should be investigated.  I have nothing against Chinese businesses.  I don’t understand how they can exist without any patrons.    Next—->  the storefronts on Halsted need to be made more presentable.  They look like dumps.  Dirty windows, for one thing.  The you can see in the vacant ones that there has been no work done to improve the interiors to make them more inviting to a business.  I can bet there are building code violations that need to be addressed and followed up on.   Who are these landlords?  Do they live in the neighborhood?   Next—->build a parking garage on 34th Street and Halsted, across from the library.  A two or three story one would be great.  Make a deal with businesses to validate their ticket and offer maybe 60 minutes free and a decent fee for anything after.  Great example is the parking lot on Canal and Taylor where DSW, Michaels and other stores are.  If you’re trying to attract new business and bring customers in you have to give them a place to park.  Street parking won’t do it.   ","A used bookstore that would also buy your books, a bowling alley, card and gift shop (think Helen’s Gift Shop that used to be on Halsted in the ‘60s. Some trendy artisan things but also lovely gifts a Mom or Grandma would like).  A family restaurant..think Bakers Square or Cracker Barrel.  Pleeze... No more Asian...including ramen, pot stickers, sushi  or noodle places....and no more Mexican places.  Another David’s or Governor’s Table...for those of you who remember them.   Music store...instruments and lessons...think Old Town School of Music.  Tutoring center for everyone...not another Chinese place.  Adults can learn computer skills such as the basics. Offer PhotoShop, Corel Draw, Card Maker, etc.  as well as Microsoft Office, PowerPoint, etc.  Students could gather for group study.
  I don’t know if anyone’s been up north but there is a place called Cat Cafe.  It offers the usual cafe fare and has cats...not a ton of them...that walk around and are available for adoption.  You don’t have to be a cat fanatic to go there...it’s a chance to sit with these sweet critters, pet them and relax.  Just an idea.   
A flower shop!!!   And at least 2 new bars....with entertainment....musicians, local?….comedians, open mike.  Why should the local young adults have to go to the northside bars.   I know the demographics of the area may factor in, but with places like I’ve suggested I feel not only the locals would respond well but they would spread the word and we’d be the new Bridgeport everyone would want to visit.  
One last thing. I think several independent businesses would set up shop on Halsted. But the building owners want ridiculously high rents and that drives them away.  Isn’t there some incentive the city could offer them to lower the rent?   There has to be!   ","Not a Starbucks!  The laundromat that was there before was great.  It was clean and very convenient.  Bring it back...put in nice tables and comfortable chairs and free Wi-Fi so customers could read or work on their gizmos.  There’s enuff room to make it bigger this time with plenty of parking.
